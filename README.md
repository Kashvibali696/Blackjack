# Blackjack Game

### This is a fun card game as the name suggests.

### Basic Blackjack Rules:
#### 1. The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
#### 2. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
#### 3. Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
#### 4. To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
#### 5. If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
#### 6. If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
#### 7. Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.
#### 8. Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
#### 9. Hitting 'Deal' will restart the game.
